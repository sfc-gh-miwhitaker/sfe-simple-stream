# Monitoring Guide - Simple Stream

**Time to Review:** ~5 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Completed [`03-TESTING.md`](03-TESTING.md) with active data flow

---

## Purpose

This guide explains how to monitor the Simple Stream pipeline using the built-in monitoring views and Snowflake system tables.

## Monitoring Overview

The pipeline includes **7 pre-built monitoring views** that provide real-time insights into:
- Ingestion rates and volumes
- End-to-end latency
- Task execution health
- Data quality metrics
- Cost tracking
- Channel status
- Active badges

All views are in the `RAW_INGESTION` schema.

---

## Core Monitoring Views

### 1. Ingestion Metrics (V_INGESTION_METRICS)

**Purpose:** Track ingestion rate, volume, and trends over time

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_INGESTION_METRICS
ORDER BY ingestion_hour DESC
LIMIT 24;
```

**Columns:**
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `ingestion_hour` | Truncated hour timestamp | 2025-11-25 14:00:00 |
| `event_count` | Total events ingested in hour | 600 |
| `avg_events_per_minute` | Average rate | 10 |
| `unique_badges` | Distinct badge IDs seen | 15 |
| `unique_users` | Distinct user IDs seen | 12 |
| `unique_zones` | Distinct zone IDs seen | 4 |

**Use Cases:**
- Identify peak ingestion times
- Detect ingestion gaps or drops
- Capacity planning (events/hour trends)

**Alerts:**
- ⚠️ `event_count = 0` for >2 hours → Ingestion stopped
- ⚠️ Sudden drop >50% → Data source issue

---

### 2. End-to-End Latency (V_END_TO_END_LATENCY)

**Purpose:** Measure time from event occurrence to analytics availability

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_END_TO_END_LATENCY
ORDER BY avg_latency_seconds DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Columns:**
| Column | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `lag_bucket` | Latency range (e.g., "0-60s") | - |
| `event_count` | Events in this bucket | - |
| `avg_latency_seconds` | Average latency | < 120s |
| `max_latency_seconds` | Maximum latency | < 180s |
| `p95_latency_seconds` | 95th percentile | < 150s |

**Use Cases:**
- SLA monitoring (are we meeting < 2 min target?)
- Identify processing bottlenecks
- Detect task scheduling delays

**Alerts:**
- ⚠️ `avg_latency_seconds > 180` → Tasks not keeping up
- ⚠️ `max_latency_seconds > 300` → Investigate warehouse sizing

**Troubleshooting:**
```sql
-- If latency is high, check task execution frequency
SELECT 
    NAME,
    STATE,
    SCHEDULE,
    LAST_COMMITTED_ON
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY())
WHERE NAME LIKE 'sfe_%'
ORDER BY SCHEDULED_TIME DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### 3. Task Execution History (V_TASK_EXECUTION_HISTORY)

**Purpose:** Monitor task success rates, duration, and errors

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_TASK_EXECUTION_HISTORY
ORDER BY scheduled_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Columns:**
| Column | Description | Healthy Value |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `task_name` | Task identifier | - |
| `scheduled_time` | When task was scheduled | Recent |
| `completed_time` | When task finished | Within 10s |
| `state` | SUCCESS / FAILED / SKIPPED | SUCCESS |
| `duration_seconds` | Execution time | < 10s |
| `error_message` | Failure details if any | NULL |
| `rows_processed` | Rows affected by task | > 0 |

**Use Cases:**
- Detect task failures
- Monitor processing performance
- Track rows processed per execution

**Alerts:**
- 🚨 `state = 'FAILED'` → Immediate investigation
- ⚠️ `duration_seconds > 30` → Warehouse may be undersized
- ⚠️ `rows_processed = 0` for >5 executions → No new data

**Common Error Patterns:**
```sql
-- Find recent task failures
SELECT 
    task_name,
    error_message,
    COUNT(*) AS failure_count
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_TASK_EXECUTION_HISTORY
WHERE state = 'FAILED'
  AND scheduled_time >= DATEADD('day', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY failure_count DESC;
```

---

### 4. Data Quality Metrics (V_DATA_QUALITY_METRICS)

**Purpose:** Track data quality issues (duplicates, orphans, signal quality)

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_DATA_QUALITY_METRICS;
```

**Metrics:**
| Metric | Description | Acceptable Range |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| `total_raw_events` | Events in RAW table | Growing |
| `total_staged_events` | Events in STG table | ~95-98% of raw |
| `total_fact_events` | Events in FCT table | ~95-100% of staged |
| `duplicate_count` | Duplicates filtered | < 5% of raw |
| `duplicate_rate` | Percentage duplicates | < 5% |
| `orphan_user_count` | Events with unknown user_id | 0 |
| `orphan_zone_count` | Events with unknown zone_id | 0 |
| `orphan_rate` | Percentage orphans | 0% |
| `weak_signal_count` | Events with RSSI < -80 dBm | Varies |
| `weak_signal_rate` | Percentage weak signals | < 10% |

**Use Cases:**
- Detect data quality degradation
- Identify missing dimension data
- Monitor RFID hardware health (signal strength)

**Alerts:**
- 🚨 `orphan_rate > 5%` → Dimension tables out of sync
- ⚠️ `duplicate_rate > 10%` → Source system issue
- ⚠️ `weak_signal_rate > 20%` → RFID reader placement or hardware issues

---

### 5. Streaming Costs (V_STREAMING_COSTS)

**Purpose:** Estimate credit consumption for cost tracking

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_STREAMING_COSTS
ORDER BY cost_date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

**Columns:**
| Column | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `cost_date` | Date of cost | Daily aggregation |
| `total_events` | Events processed | - |
| `estimated_gb_ingested` | Data volume | Avg ~200 bytes/event |
| `estimated_credits` | Credit consumption | $2/credit (Standard) |
| `estimated_cost_usd` | Dollar cost estimate | Based on $2/credit |

**Formula:**
```
Credits = (GB ingested × 0.06) + (Task execution seconds / 3600 × Warehouse size)
Cost = Credits × Price per credit
```

**Use Cases:**
- Budget tracking and forecasting
- Cost anomaly detection
- Chargeback/showback reporting

**Alerts:**
- ⚠️ Daily cost increases >50% → Investigate volume spike
- ⚠️ Cost per event increases → Inefficient processing

---

### 6. Channel Status (V_CHANNEL_STATUS)

**Purpose:** Monitor Snowpipe Streaming channel health

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_CHANNEL_STATUS
ORDER BY last_poll_time DESC;
```

**Columns:**
| Column | Description | Healthy State |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `channel_name` | Unique channel identifier | - |
| `status` | OPEN / CLOSED / ERROR | OPEN or CLOSED |
| `last_poll_time` | Most recent activity | Recent |
| `rows_ingested` | Total rows via this channel | Growing |
| `bytes_ingested` | Total bytes | Growing |
| `error_count` | Errors encountered | 0 |

**Use Cases:**
- Detect channel errors or stalls
- Track active vs. closed channels
- Monitor ingestion volume per channel

**Alerts:**
- 🚨 `status = 'ERROR'` → Check pipe error messages
- ⚠️ `last_poll_time > 5 minutes ago` + `status = OPEN` → Channel stalled

---

### 7. Active Badges (V_ACTIVE_BADGES)

**Purpose:** Track currently active badges in the system

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RAW_INGESTION.V_ACTIVE_BADGES
ORDER BY last_seen DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Columns:**
| Column | Description | Use |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `badge_id` | Badge identifier | - |
| `user_id` | Associated user | - |
| `user_name` | User full name | From dimension |
| `last_zone` | Last seen zone | - |
| `last_seen` | Most recent event | - |
| `event_count_today` | Events today | Activity level |

**Use Cases:**
- Real-time occupancy monitoring
- Identify inactive badges
- Security (unexpected badges)

## System-Level Monitoring

### Warehouse Utilization

**Check warehouse credit consumption:**
```sql
SELECT 
    WAREHOUSE_NAME,
    START_TIME,
    END_TIME,
    CREDITS_USED,
    CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE,
    CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'COMPUTE_WH'
  AND START_TIME >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
```

**Warehouse efficiency:**
```sql
-- Check for idle time (credits wasted)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', START_TIME) AS day,
    SUM(CREDITS_USED) AS total_credits,
    SUM(CASE WHEN CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE = 0 THEN CREDITS_USED ELSE 0 END) AS idle_credits,
    idle_credits / total_credits * 100 AS idle_percent
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'COMPUTE_WH'
  AND START_TIME >= DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

**Target:** `idle_percent < 10%`

### Storage Growth

**Monitor database storage:**
```sql
SELECT 
    TABLE_CATALOG AS database_name,
    TABLE_SCHEMA AS schema_name,
    SUM(ACTIVE_BYTES) / POWER(1024, 3) AS active_storage_gb,
    SUM(TIME_TRAVEL_BYTES) / POWER(1024, 3) AS time_travel_storage_gb,
    SUM(FAILSAFE_BYTES) / POWER(1024, 3) AS failsafe_storage_gb,
    SUM(ACTIVE_BYTES + TIME_TRAVEL_BYTES + FAILSAFE_BYTES) / POWER(1024, 3) AS total_storage_gb
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS
WHERE TABLE_CATALOG = 'SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE'
  AND ACTIVE_BYTES > 0
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY total_storage_gb DESC;
```

**Alert:** Unexpected storage growth (>10% per day without corresponding event increase)

### Query Performance

**Check slowest queries:**
```sql
SELECT 
    QUERY_ID,
    QUERY_TEXT,
    EXECUTION_STATUS,
    TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME / 1000 AS execution_time_sec,
    BYTES_SCANNED / POWER(1024, 3) AS gb_scanned,
    PARTITIONS_SCANNED,
    PARTITIONS_TOTAL
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE EXECUTION_STATUS = 'SUCCESS'
  AND START_TIME >= DATEADD('day', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE'
ORDER BY TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Optimization Targets:**
- `execution_time_sec < 5` for OLTP queries
- `partitions_scanned / partitions_total < 0.1` (good pruning)

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Issue: "No data flowing"

**Steps:**
1. Check pipe status: `SHOW PIPES;`
2. Check channel status: `SELECT * FROM V_CHANNEL_STATUS;`
3. Check task status: `SHOW TASKS;` (should be `started`, not `suspended`)
4. Check for task errors: `SELECT * FROM V_TASK_EXECUTION_HISTORY WHERE state = 'FAILED';`

### Issue: "High latency"

**Steps:**
1. Check task execution frequency: `V_TASK_EXECUTION_HISTORY`
2. Check warehouse size: `SHOW WAREHOUSES;`
3. Check for spill to disk: `Query profile for tasks → look for bytes_spilled`
4. Consider increasing warehouse size or reducing task interval

### Issue: "Orphan records"

**Steps:**
1. Find orphaned IDs: 
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT user_id 
   FROM RAW_BADGE_EVENTS 
   WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM ANALYTICS_LAYER.DIM_USERS WHERE is_current = TRUE);
   ```
2. Add missing dimensions or fix source data to use valid IDs
